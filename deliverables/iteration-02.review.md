 ##LIMBSFREE GROUP 4

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.     
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Having a hackathon like event where the whole team met up for one day in bahen during reading week to work on the project. This was a very good idea because working together in person made communication extremely efficient. We completed a sizable chunk of the project during this "hackathon," and every member updated everyone else on their progress and their plan for the rest of the iteration (and got to try the software).

Having a Chrome extension that modifies the UI by adding buttons on to the sides of the browser. It is a successful decision for several reasons. Firstly, buttons are efficient to add. Secondly, it creates a far cleaner UI, and having it on the sides makes it more accessible to our webcam-mouse. The addition of buttons in the Chrome extension greatly improved the usability of the software. This will be shown in our demo video.

Adding a button that creates a new tab. This is a very convenient feature since the new tab button on the browser is frequently used but is too difficult to locate using the webcam-mouse. Adding in this button greatly increases the efficiency of operation that the user will definitely benefit from. Again, this will be shown in our demo video too. 

Lastly, from iteration 1 we realized our project could consist of more, so we added in a website and landing page to our project. Adding in a website and landing page for the new tab increased the scope of our project to a more appropriate level for six members. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

One of our members didn't realize he was supposed to implement a landing page for new tab, because we forgot to put it on the trello board. This miscommunication could have caused problems, but luckily another member reached out in time to remind him and it will be completed for the due date. The decision to use Trello has been extremely successful overall, but we need to be careful not to be over reliant on it.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

For our Chrome extension, create a button that hides all other buttons. This gives the user the option to hide the other buttons if they please and solves the potential problem of our extension buttons covering up functions on the webpage.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Look into other ways to make our Chrome extension easier to download. Right now the extension is available in the Chrome Web store for free download. We will look for other ways for users to download the extension, such as having it directly available in our website or have it packaged with our webcam-mouse installation.

Look for possible improvements on our Chrome extension. We will look for potential areas for improvement for our extension. The main idea we have currently is to add voice command, and potentially voice typing, to our extension. This would require a lot of research and work.
