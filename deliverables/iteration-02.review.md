## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 Wednesday, March 8th 2017 at UC244 (physically)

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

Having a hackathon like event where the whole team met up for one day in bahen during reading week to work on the project. This was a very good idea because working together in person made communication extremely efficient. We completed a sizable chunk of the project during this "hackathon," and every member updated everyone else on their progress and their plan for the rest of the iteration (and got to try the software).

Having a Chrome extension that modifies the UI by adding buttons on to the sides of the browser. It is a successful decision for several reasons. Firstly, buttons are efficient to add. Secondly, it creates a far cleaner UI, and having it on the sides makes it more accessible to our webcam-mouse. The addition of buttons in the Chrome extension greatly improved the usability of the software. This will be shown in our demo video.

Adding a button that creates a new tab. This is a very convenient feature since the new tab button on the browser is frequently used but is too difficult to locate using the webcam-mouse. Adding in this button greatly increases the efficiency of operation that the user will definitely benefit from. Again, this will be shown in our demo video too. 

Lastly, from iteration 1 we realized our project could consist of more, so we added in a website and landing page to our project. Adding in a website and landing page for the new tab increased the scope of our project to a more appropriate level for six members. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

One of our members didn't realize he was supposed to implement a landing page for new tab, because we forgot to put it on the trello board. This miscommunication could have caused problems, but luckily another member reached out in time to remind him and it will be completed for the due date. The decision to use Trello has been extremely successful overall, but we need to be careful not to be over reliant on it.

Due to the difficulty and the lack of reliability in detecting blinks, we have ultimately decided to scrap the blink-detection function and to settle with holding of the head for 5 seconds to click. The problem was that the haar classifiers that detected blinking were not that great and would often fail 50% of the time; misfiring clicks. Due to the lack of time, Timothy and Raymond decided not to invest numerous hours into training the computer and instead focus their resources elsewhere. 


#### Planned changes

For our Chrome extension, create a button that hides all other buttons. This gives the user the option to hide the other buttons if they please and solves the potential problem of our extension buttons covering up functions on the webpage. 

In addition to the hide All button, the team plans to incorperate back, forwards, etc to the extension so that the user does not have to rely on the on-screen buttons; especially when they are hidden during full-screen mode. 

In terms of the webcam software, plans are put into place to incorperate a sentitivity menu so that the user can adjust how sensitive the mouse cursor is. This is due to the mixed criticism from many of our testers where some would say its too slow while some say that its just right. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

The chrome extension which created a UI containing buttons for zooming in, zooming out, reset zoom, and create new tab was completed. We can refer to the demo video we filmed to show this. 

The webcam software now fully supports scrolling and clicking. It also has a calibration squence that lets the computer learn from the user. This is ran at the very beggining of the launch of the program. 

The chrome extension is successfully published on the Chrome Extension store where users can download for free.

Lastly, progress was made on both the website and the landing page (despite the fact that the team member in charge of the landing page didn't realize he had to do it). 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

   
The webcam software still requires calibration on the current code it has. It has trouble detecting people with long hair covering their faces and is rather slow at moving the cursor around the screen. 

Voice input is a function we will be trying to implement in the future for chrome extension.

Installation of webcam software and the chrome extension will be combined for easier user experience.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Look into other ways to make our Chrome extension easier to download. Right now the extension is available in the Chrome Web store for free download. We will look for other ways for users to download the extension, such as having it directly available in our website or have it packaged with our webcam-mouse installation.

Look for possible improvements on our Chrome extension. We will look for potential areas for improvement for our extension. The main idea we have currently is to add voice command, and potentially voice typing, to our extension. This would require a lot of research and work.

The website and landing page also need to be completely finished by the end of the next iteration.
