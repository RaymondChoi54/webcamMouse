 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Having a hackathon like event where the whole team met up for one day in bahen during reading week to work on the project. This was a very good idea because working together in person made communication extremely efficient. We completed a sizable chunk of the project during this "hackathon," and every member updated everyone else on their progress (and got to try the software!).

Having a Chrome extension that modifies the UI by adding buttons on to the sides of the browser. It is a successful decision for several reasons. Firstly, buttons are efficient to add. Secondly, it creates a far cleaner UI, and having it on the sides makes it more accessible to our webcam-mouse. The addition of buttons in the Chrome extension greatly improved the usability of the software. This will be apparent in our demo video.

Adding a button that creates a new tab. This is a very convenient feature since the new tab button on the browser is frequently used but is too difficult to locate using the webcam-mouse.
