# LIMBSFREE PROJECT TEAM 4

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, March 23th 2017
 * Where: UC244

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

We are overall very happy with our process decisions. It worked very smoothly for this iteration. The most important decision we took as a group that lead to success was to finish the majority of the product work in the last iteration during reading week (this was cleared with the TA). So we spent the majority of this iteration putting the finishing touches on our product and made it even more effective, since the hard work was already done.

One decision we changed from the last iteration was to use Facebook MEssenger instead of Slack. This worked out great, as everyone uses Facebook regularly anyway - our “being in the loop” was much higher for each member this iteration (to give you an informal metric).




#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

We don’t really have any process related decisions that were unsuccessful at this point. We improved greatly following the process we decided on as opposed to the last iteration.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

There will be no changes.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

***rohan’s note: fill in what you did here

Completed the website.

Sensitivity adjustment has been completed. Now the user is able to select how sensitive they want the mouse to be since the webcam software operates in a TrackPoint-style rather than TrackPad-style. 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

***rohan’s note: add what you did here, if there was anything. James I believe you found Voice input hard so put that here.

The Windows installer was not made using InstallCreator. Instead, an alternative was used where the user would run the install batch file to install the program. Then they would run the "run" batch file to launch the program. 

Sensitivity is not saved into a file since the sentitivty selection is integrated with the calibration process of the webcam software and would be launched every time the calibration process is launched. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

We are very happy with the way our product turned out. Our planning decisions lead to very high productivity in the previous iteration, so this iteration was a breeze. This ensured that we could make our accessibility software as effective as possible. 

At this point, our product is 99% complete and our process is as efficient as it is going to get. So we know we need to maintain our productivity/communication and prep for the final demo as we did for this iteration.
