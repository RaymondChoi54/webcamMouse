## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

We are overall very happy with our process decisions. It worked very smoothly for this iteration. The most important decision we took as a group that lead to success was to finish the majority of the product work in the last iteration during reading week (this was cleared with the TA). So we spent the majority of this iteration putting the finishing touches on our product and made it even more effective, since the hard work was already done.

One decision we changed from the last iteration was to use Facebook MEssenger instead of Slack. This worked out great, as everyone uses Facebook regularly anyway - our “being in the loop” was much higher for each member this iteration (to give you an informal metric).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

We don’t really have any process related decisions that were unsuccessful at this point. We improved greatly following the process we decided on as opposed to the last iteration.

#### Planned changes

There will be no changes.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

Completed a back button that takes user to the previous page. Added buttons for youtube to pause and play videos.

Completed the website.

Sensitivity adjustment has been completed. Now the user is able to select how sensitive they want the mouse to be since the webcam software operates in a TrackPoint-style rather than TrackPad-style. 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We thought of implementing voice input to our chrome extension. However, we determined that it isn't that useful since the facial tracking feature is working really well. Also, we discovered that we can utilize the google search voice control, which integrates really well with our extension.

The Windows installer was not made using InstallCreator. Instead, an alternative was used where the user would run the install batch file to install the program. Then they would run the "run" batch file to launch the program. 

Sensitivity is not saved into a file since the sentitivty selection is integrated with the calibration process of the webcam software and would be launched every time the calibration process is launched. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

We are very happy with the way our product turned out. Our planning decisions lead to very high productivity in the previous iteration, so this iteration was a breeze. This ensured that we could make our accessibility software as effective as possible. 

At this point, our product is 99% complete and our process is as efficient as it is going to get. So we know we need to maintain our productivity/communication and prep for the final demo as we did for this iteration.
