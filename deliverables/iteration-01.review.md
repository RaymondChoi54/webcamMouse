# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, February 9th 2017
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
Using python for the cursor control because 1) compatible with OpenCV 2) compatible with group member skillsets<br><br>
Never made extension but it is a project which we feel is appropriate given our skillset<br><br>
Using Trello and Slack for project management. Our project management is going well.<br><br>


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Project is too simple in scope for 6 people; the amount of work we put in for iteration 1 was not enough <br><br>
Originally used nose tracking, then had to switch to eyes due to inaccuracies; then had to switch yet again to face tracking due to further inaccuracies <br><br>
Trying to embed OpenCV in a Chrome extension: hard to control the mouse with a Chrome extension - just making script downloadable <br><br>


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

Adding a website where users can view a demo and download the project <br><br>
Need to figure out method to click; each choice has a tradeoff/dilemma <br><br>

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 
TODO: please all write down the tasks you completed you completed. <br><br>

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

None - we all met our tasks. However, at the last minute we decided to add the website. Due to the decision being taken before the due date, the group member in charge of that (Rohan) did not commit any code for that part.<br><br>


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.


As stated earlier, our project scope is too limited. We are thus going to build a website where users can download the software and extension from. This will give our project a more professional feel.<br><br>
Extension needs work TODO <br><br>
Need to come up with method for clicking TODO<br><br>
Everyone is on the same page, and we are working together very well. Our task management (via Trello) is running smoothly, and we have all made good progress on the work we were individually assigned (all targets were met for this iteration) <br><br>
