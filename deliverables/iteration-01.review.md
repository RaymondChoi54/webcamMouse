## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, February 9th 2017
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well
 
Using python for the cursor control because 1) compatible with OpenCV 2) compatible with group member skillsets<br><br>
Never made extension but it is a project which we feel is appropriate given our skillset<br><br>
Using Trello and Slack for project management. Our project management is going well.<br><br>


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Project is too simple in scope for 6 people; the amount of work we put in for iteration 1 was not enough <br><br>
Originally used nose tracking, then had to switch to eyes due to inaccuracies; then had to switch yet again to face tracking due to further inaccuracies <br><br>
Trying to embed OpenCV in a Chrome extension: hard to control the mouse with a Chrome extension - just making script downloadable <br><br>


#### Planned changes

Adding a website where users can view a demo and download the project <br><br>
Need to figure out method to click; each choice has a tradeoff/dilemma <br><br>


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


Got OpenCV to track facial features (in /webcam_mouse). 
On track for cursor control (in /webcam_mouse). 
Created a very basic chrome extension, getting familiar with chrome extensions (in /chrome_extension).
Started on a website where users can view a demo and download the project (in /website). This was not in the original iteration plan.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


None - we all met our tasks. However, at the last minute we decided to add the website. Due to the decision being taken before the due date, the group member in charge of that (Rohan) did not commit any code for that part.<br><br>


## Meeting Highlights


As stated earlier, our project scope is too limited. We are thus going to build a website where users can download the software and extension from. This will give our project a more professional feel.<br><br>
Extension needs work TODO <br><br>
Need to come up with method for clicking TODO<br><br>
Everyone is on the same page, and we are working together very well. Our task management (via Trello) is running smoothly, and we have all made good progress on the work we were individually assigned (all targets were met for this iteration) <br><br>
