# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, February 9th 2017
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
-Using python for the cursor control because 1) compatible with OpenCV 2) compatible with group member skillsets <br>
-Never made extension but it is a project which we feel is appropriate given our skillset <br>
-Using Trello and Slack for project management <br>


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

-Project is too simple in scope for 6 people; the amount of work we put in for iteration 1 was not enough <br>
-Originally used nose tracking, then had to switch to eyes due to inaccuracies; then had to switch yet again to face tracking due to further inaccuracies <br>
-Trying to embed OpenCV in a Chrome extension: hard to control the mouse with a Chrome extension - just making script downloadable <br>


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

-Adding a website where users can view a demo and download the project <br>
-Need to figure out method to click; each choice has a tradeoff/dilemma <br>

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
